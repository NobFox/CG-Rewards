# CG-Rewards
Creates an XML import file for MacroMaker to deal rewards in the chat

# Usage

Add all tips (one per line) to the Rewards.txt file in the following format:
!tip NobFox 1 BTC Reward for challenge

Running the PowerShell script will read the file and create an XML output that is compatible with MacroMaker (https://macromaker.en.softonic.com/). The macro will move the mouse cursor to the bottom right of the monitor, click in the chat box and send all the tips out. If you have multiple monitors, it will go to the furthest on the left.
